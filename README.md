# OIT-Project

The aim of this project is to create an application that makes Instagram more accessible for users with disabilities by simplifying the user interface so that users can interact and view Instagram content more easily. 

## Front End Development Options

I have chosen to use the ReactJS library to build and create the user interface. The pros of using this method are the fast user interface, reusable code, single page applications can be created, and only the parts of the library that are needed can be extracted. Some potential issues could be that this requires specialist knowledge to use it effectively, and I will be unable to perform 'business logic' actions within the application. 

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to access an online application that allows me to view a simplified Instagram feed, so that I can use it more easily

### Epic Breakdown - Front End

As the PRESENTATIONAL LAYER, I want to be able to request data from the BUSINESS LAYER, so that I can display it.

#### Further Epic Breakdown - Front End

1. As the PRESENTATIONAL LAYER, I want to be able to display pictures in a 'feed' UI, so that the user is able to see all the pictures.

- [ ] Get a ReactJS application up and running. 

2. As the PRESENTATIONAL LAYER, I want to be able to display each picture with a user name, so that I can see who has posted the picture.
3. As the PRESENTATIONAL LAYER, I want to be able to display each picture with a caption, so that I can read what each picture is about.
